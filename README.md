# Project Motor Poster

***The project started with a 2-day workshop in the field of physical computing. There I got a deeper insight about the scope of physical computing, which were illustrated with realized projects. Then I tried my first Circuits and first lines of code with the Arduino Uno.***

## Exercise

The task of the project was to create an motorized Poster or object. It was possible that only the pure passive presence of the observer serves as input and thus triggers the output.

## The idea

In a relatively short time I decided upon a project idea in order to have enough time for implementation, because I could not estimate the complexity of such a project then.

I decided to create a game, in which the viewer passively triggers the game and has a 50:50 chance of winning. Two sliders, with two different icons move back and forth for a short moment. Then they stop randomly and it is checked whether a match exists or not. A third slider shows the resultver.
Subsequently, the project idea should be put in a simple video-prototype.
